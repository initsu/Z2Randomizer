Biome is Caldera
Climate is Chaos

this fails to generate Death Mountain (generation hangs)

even forcing the size magically to be 64x75 does not fix it

the root problem is in

> Terraforming.DrawBridge

as we keep trying to find water on the east border but

> FindWaterTileAtEdge

keeps returning false in an endless loop

this probably needs a bigger fix. like force-creating a bridge and water if all else fails?
